# Detect all different devices and associate correctly with each string (devices need numbers or some marker)

# Store all devices in a list so that the data can be traced back to those devices

# Perform a MPPT Tracking for each device continuously

# Perform periodic JV Curves by changing resistance from infinite to 0 and measuring voltage and current

# Calculate from the JV curves the necessary parameters (Jsc Voc ...) (if you get cocky make an http request to get the
#irradiance on that day to calculate efficiency

# Save the JV Curves in a separate folder with timestamp

# Save an MPPT graph for the day as well as the data in a txt file

# Append all the data into a combined file and plot it on real time
